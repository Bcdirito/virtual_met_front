Virtual Met is a single-page Vanilla JavaScript application with a Ruby on Rails backend

Take procured tours of the Met 5th Ave Museum with the Virtual Met. With accompanying music, access to the Met's database, and already predetermined works, you can browse through up to six departments!

## To Run Locally:
  1. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
  
  2. Input "open index.html"
  
  3. A tab should open in your browser that will take you to the app!
  
## How it Works:
  1. From the home screen, you may choose to play music and/or select a department in either of the dropdown menus.
  
  2. Once you have selected a department, the music will pause and change to a different piece, since every department has its own music!
  
  3. Once you have selected a tour, you may move through different works by either clicking the arrows or hitting the corresponding arrow keys on your mouse.
  
  4. To make a work modal, click on the image!
  
  5. If you want to learn more, click on the "Learn More" link to see the Met's individual page for that work.
  
  6. Enjoy!
  
## Additional Notes:
  1. Music works best if you listen with headphones.
  
  2. If viewing in full-page, do note that clicking on "Learn More" opens another tab in your browser. Make sure to close the tab and not the window.
